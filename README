This project provides you with a bash library to controll a NetIO 230A LAN IP Remote Socket.

The library currently only can controll one netio at a time. if you want to controll more you have
to logout/login whenever you switch between them. The login will be remembered for the current
script or bash instance until a logout is done.

Here are some basic example of the useage:

# import the library

source libnetio230a.sh

# login to the NetIO at 192.168.1.10 with encrypted login user power password 123

netio.login 192.168.1.10 c power 123

# get status of port 3 and print it

netio.getport 192.168.1.10 3
echo $?

# set port 4 to off

netio.setport 192.168.1.10 4 0

# logout

netio.logout
